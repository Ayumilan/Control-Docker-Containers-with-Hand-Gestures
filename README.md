Control Docker Containers with Hand Gestures!

Introducing a small project: a unique combination of computer vision and containerization. Now, you can effortlessly control Docker containers using simple hand gestures! 🖐💻

By leveraging OpenCV and Python, I've developed a system that detects hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. Based on the finger positions, the system creates or removes Docker containers. 🙌

Here's how it works(right):
- Raise one finger: Creates one Docker container.
- Raise two fingers: Creates two Docker containers.
- Raise three fingers: Creates three Docker containers.
- Raise four fingers: Creates four Docker containers.
- Raise all five fingers: Creates five Docker containers.

Similarly, you can use hand gestures to remove Docker containers(left):
- Raise one finger: Removes one Docker container.
- Raise two fingers: Removes two Docker containers.
- Raise three fingers: Removes three Docker containers.
- Raise four fingers: Removes four Docker containers.
- Raise all five fingers: Removes five Docker containers.
